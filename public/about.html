<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Charles! I’m passionate about technology, learning, and building creative projects. Over the past few years, I’ve been diving into web development, networking, and cybersecurity. I enjoy experimenting with new tools, coding projects, and finding ways to bring ideas to life on the web.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I’m also interested in business and entrepreneurship. I’ve explored projects in marketing, finance, and even starting small businesses. For me, learning new skills isn’t just a hobby it’s part of how I want to grow personally and professionally.</p>

<p>When I’m not working on projects or studying, you can usually find me reading, working out, or exploring new ideas that inspire me. This website is my little corner of the internet where I can share my journey and connect with people who are just as curious and driven as I am.</p>
